# Finetuning Models

## Techniques
- Evaluate Model
- Diagnose Bias and Variance


### Evaluate Model
- Split Data to Training Data, Cross Validation Data and Test Data
- Find Error rate with different Models and find how data performs on different Models

### Diagnose Bias and Variance
- Bias is Underfit and Variance is overfit
- In case of High Bias Training Error : High and Validation Error : High 
- In case of High Variance Training Error : Low and Validation Error : High
