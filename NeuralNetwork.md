# Neural Network
- Neural Network is a cluster of logistic regression performed in sequence
- Each Previous Layer's output is considered as input variable to the next layer
- Each node of computing is called a neuron, where a logistic regression equation is solved using sigmoid function

## Tensorflow
- Tensorflow and Keras are machine learning packages widely used in neural networks
- Tensorflow always accepts data as 2 dimensional matrix, hence declare the values in numpy with 2 square brackets e.g. of 2x3 matrix :  `np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])`
