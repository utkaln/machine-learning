## Important Python Concepts

### NumPy
- Library that has most of statistics and analytics library
- Install : `pip3 install numpy`
- Import into python file : `import numpy as np`
- Vector Multiplication Syntax: `np.dot(v1,v2)`
- More Interesting Examples: [NumPyDemo.py](./utilities/NumPyDemo.py)

## Scikit
- Popular libraries are available for statistics and data analytics
- **z score normalization** to bring features into a manageable scale - [StandardScaler](./linear-regression/ScikitUtils.py#L10)
- **gradient descent regression model** - [sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor](./linear-regression/ScikitUtils.py)
