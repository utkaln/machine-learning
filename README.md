# machine-learning

### Basics
- Machine Learning starts with two broader categories:
  - Supervised Learning
    - [Linear Regression](RegressionClassification.md)
    - [Logistic Classification](RegressionClassification.md)
    - [Neural Network](NeuralNetwork.md)
    - [Finetune Models](FineTuneModels.md)
    - [Decision Trees](DecisionTrees.md)
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - [Transformers and LLMs](LLMs.md)

## Gen AI and LLMs
- Popular Foundational LLMs are : BLOOM, GPT, LlaMa, FLAN-T5, BERT, PaLM. These are already trained on some data. Hence called base models. More pre training can be done on these
- This repo has labs using FLAN-T5 adoptions for LLMs
- The big difference between other Machine Learning Models and LLMs are that, usual Machine Learning Models have APIs, Libraries, Specific syntaxes etc. where as LLM is able to understand human language
- [LLMs](LLMs.md)




## How to
- Python is the choice of language for Data Science [Read More](./python.md)
- Packages to be installed for this repo :
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`
